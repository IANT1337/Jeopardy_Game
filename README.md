## Remote Play

### Local Network Access (Same WiFi/LAN)

To allow friends on the same network to join:

1. **Find your local IP address**:
   - Windows: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
   - Mac/Linux: `ifconfig` in Terminal
   - Look for your network adapter's IP (usually starts with 192.168.x.x)

2. **Share the Session Information**:
   - Give contestants the Session ID (displayed after creating a session)
   - Contestants use: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000` and enter the Session ID
   - Example: contestants go to `http://192.168.1.100:3000`, click "Join as Contestant", and enter the Session ID

### External Access (Internet)

To allow friends from anywhere on the internet to join:

#### Quick Setup (Windows):
1. **Run the automated setup script as Administrator**:
   ```powershell
   .\setup-external-access.ps1
   ```
   This will configure Windows Firewall and show you your network details.

2. **Configure router port forwarding**:
   - Access your router admin panel (usually http://192.168.1.1 or http://192.168.0.1)
   - Find "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Servers" section
   - Create a new rule:
     * External Port: 3000
     * Internal Port: 3000
     * Internal IP: [Your local IP from the script]
     * Protocol: TCP

3. **Test your setup**:
   ```powershell
   .\test-network.ps1
   ```

4. **Share your public IP**:
   - Find your public IP at https://whatismyipaddress.com/
   - Contestants connect to: `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000`

#### Manual Setup:

1. **Configure Windows Firewall**:
   ```powershell
   # Run as Administrator
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Jeopardy Game" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 3000 -Action Allow
   ```

2. **Configure Router Port Forwarding**:
   - Log into your router's admin interface
   - Forward external port 3000 to your computer's local IP on port 3000
   - Enable the rule

3. **Find Your Public IP**: 
   - Visit https://whatismyipaddress.com/
   - Share this IP with external contestants: `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000`

#### Security Considerations for External Access:
- Only run the game server when actively hosting
- Use strong host passwords
- Monitor the console for connection logs
- Consider using a VPN service for additional security

## Customization

- **Host Password**: Set the `HOST_PASSWORD` environment variable to change from the default `jeopardy2025`
- **Port**: Change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable
- **Questions**: Edit `questions.txt` to customize categories and questions
- **Styling**: Modify the CSS in the HTML files to change the appearance
- **Game Logic**: Adjust rules in `server.js` (Daily Double probability, scoring, etc.)

## Security Features

- **Host Authentication**: Password protection for creating and managing games
- **Session Isolation**: Each game runs in its own session with unique ID
- **Session Timeouts**: Inactive sessions are automatically cleaned up after 24 hours
- **IP Tracking**: Host can see contestant IP addresses for monitoring

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and Socket.IO
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections via Socket.IO
- **File Structure**:
  ```
  /
  â”œâ”€â”€ server.js          # Main server file
  â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Dependencies
  â”œâ”€â”€ questions.txt      # Game questions
  â””â”€â”€ public/
      â”œâ”€â”€ index.html     # Landing page
      â”œâ”€â”€ host.html      # Host interface
      â””â”€â”€ contestant.html # Contestant interface
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't connect**: Check firewall settings and ensure the server is running
- **Questions not loading**: Verify `questions.txt` format (tab-separated, proper structure)
- **Buzzer not working**: Make sure JavaScript is enabled and connection is stable
- **Performance issues**: Limit number of concurrent contestants (recommended: 3-6 players)

## Development

To run in development mode with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This requires `nodemon` which is included in the dev dependencies.

Enjoy your Jeopardy game!
